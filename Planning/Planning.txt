http://www.advsofteng.com/gallery_finance.html
Need to figure out annotations. Some way to say "buy and sell" without getting clunky.

Need to read some more about this.

data
eoddata.com - historical

daily-
@todo: Make sure we have up-to-date stock lists. EODdata for that?
@todo: Write a parser for google data.
google - doesn't need exchange ticker for us entities!!!
https://www.google.com/finance/getprices?i=60&p=100d&f=d,o,h,l,c,v&df=cpct&q=GOOG

pre and post markey EOD. google hard limits to 9:30-4.

Parse through this puppy every day at 5, 6, w/e.

Framework:
Symfony

Methodology
Work on having two layers (applications) - maybe not,
	A data sytem (database, candles, alerts, must be fast backend)
	A presentation layer (make it pretty, presentable, and fast)




TODO:

Backend:
Have the parser create hourly, daily and weekly candles.

Alert system tracking


Frontend: 
Lets make some pretty candles - figure out charting



Performance / security: 
Turn output flushing back off before production
xdebug SUCKS at performance handling. Turn it on if you need it. Currently disabled in php.ini


Goals:
Feb 21:
    Have an auto-pull-down method for candles
    try to have all candles on RDS
    have an alert-tracking (transaction) system worked out

Feb 28:
    Have all candles on RDS
    Parse candles for hour, day and week - all separate tables
